Market Trading Bot with Built-In Simulator
Introduction
Have you ever wondered how traders make decisions about buying or selling assets like Bitcoin or gold? The financial markets can be complex and dynamic, influenced by countless factors that are often hard to predict. To navigate this complexity, traders use various strategies and tools to analyze market data and make informed decisions.
This project aims to develop a market trading bot with an integrated simulation engine. In simpler terms, it's a software application that can:
Analyze historical market data for multiple assets.
Apply different trading strategies to decide when to buy or sell.
Simulate trades to see how those strategies would have performed in the past.
Evaluate performance using key financial metrics.
Note: This is an early-stage project and is currently unpolished. It's a work in progress, and many features are either incomplete or in development.

Project Overview
Features
Multiple Assets Support: Ability to handle and compare multiple assets simultaneously (e.g., Bitcoin, gold).
Modular Design: Components like strategies and indicators are modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.
Trading Strategies: Implementation of various trading strategies, each encapsulated in its own module.
Simulation Engine: Run backtests on historical data to simulate trading performance.
Performance Evaluation: Assess strategies using metrics like account balance, profit/loss per trade, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe Ratio.
Extensible API: A cohesive API between modules to facilitate integration and scalability.
What's Being Worked On
Portfolio Weight-Based Trading: Transitioning from raw buy/sell signals to strategies that trade based on target portfolio weights.
Rebalancing Logic: Implementing functions to rebalance the portfolio according to target weights while considering transaction costs.
Risk Management: Incorporating risk metrics and constraints into the trading strategies.
Enhanced Performance Metrics: Developing tools to evaluate the strategies more comprehensively.
